# **Movie Recommendation System in C++**

This project is a simple movie recommendation system that calculates and recommends the top \( k \) movies based on their average ratings using a user-movie rating matrix.

---

## **Features**
- Reads a user-movie ratings matrix from a CSV file.
- Calculates average ratings for each movie, ignoring unrated entries (`0`).
- Uses a max heap to efficiently find the top \( k \) highest-rated movies.
- Outputs the top \( k \) recommended movies with their average ratings.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Language:** C++
- **Tools:** Standard Template Library (STL) for data structures (e.g., `priority_queue`), File I/O for reading CSV files.

---

## **Setup and Usage**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
```

### **2. Prepare the Input File**
The program expects a `ratings.csv` file in the following format:
- Rows represent users.
- Columns represent movies.
- Ratings are integers (1 to 5), with `0` indicating unrated movies.

#### **Example Input File (`ratings.csv`):**
```
5,3,0,1,4
4,0,0,1,2
0,1,2,4,0
3,0,4,0,3
```

### **3. Compile the Code**
Use a C++ compiler to compile the source code:
```bash
g++ -o movie_recommendation movie_recommendation.cpp
```

### **4. Run the Program**
Execute the compiled program:
```bash
./movie_recommendation
```

### **5. Output**
The program displays the top \( k \) movies based on average ratings.

#### **Example Output:**
For \( k = 3 \):
```
Top 3 movies based on average ratings:
Movie 1 with average rating 4.00
Movie 5 with average rating 3.00
Movie 3 with average rating 3.00
```

## **Code Overview**

### **1. Functions**
- **`loadRatingsMatrix`**: Reads the user-movie rating matrix from a CSV file.
- **`calculateAverageRatings`**: Calculates the average rating for each movie.
- **`findTopKMovies`**: Finds the top \( k \) movies using a max heap.
- **`main`**: Orchestrates the program flow.

### **2. File Structure**
```
movie-recommendation-system/
├── movie_recommendation.cpp   # Main program source code
├── ratings.csv                # Sample input file (user-movie ratings matrix)
├── README.md                  # Project documentation
```

---

## **Customization**

- **Change \( k \):**
  Modify the value of `k` in the `main()` function:
  ```cpp
  int k = 5; // Example: Get top 5 movies
  ```

- **Input File:**
  Replace `ratings.csv` with your file name or path.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Add item-based collaborative filtering for personalized recommendations.
- Implement real-time input for user ratings.
- Visualize recommendations using a simple web interface.
